                <h2>Hello, I'm Pierre</h2>
                <p>A 29-year-old aspiring software developer from Antwerp. 
                    Originally trained in criminology, I recently discovered a passion for
                     software development and testing, which has led me to pursue a 
                     new path in programming. 
                     During my first experiences with coding, I have already enjoyed diving into tackling challenging problems a lot. I’m eager to learn as much as possible and one day hope to work 
                       as a developer in a position where i can make a positive impact on society.

                  </div>
                  <p>I started my professional journey as a <span>KYC analyst</span> and a <span>consultant for the youth court</span>. It quickly became clear that I hadn’t yet found the right career path. Though my education is in a different field, I've always had a <span>deep interest in Tech and IT</span>. Opportunely, a friend invited me to interview for a test engineering role. At the time, I had no background in <span>software testing</span>, but I quickly immersed myself in studying the theory behind this subject and found it incredibly engaging.
                  </p>                 
                </div>

                <div class="card">
                <p> Though I didn’t land the job due to my lack of experience, the process inspired me to
                   earn an ISTQB certification and continue exploring software testing in-depth. I began networking
                    with professionals in the field, and they encouraged me to look into <span> Campus 19</span>,
                     a free coding bootcamp.  Initially, the prospect of learning to code was intimidating-developers
                      had always seemed like the magicians of our time, and I questioned if I could keep up.
                       Still, I decided to take the leap, and <span>in September, I dedicated myself fully to
                        learning programming</span>.

                <div class="card">
                <p>The intensive month-long <span>“Piscine”</span> was eye-opening. Coding was as challenging as I’d imagined, but also very rewarding. 
                  I studied alongside people from all backgrounds, tackling complex problems without any teachers to guide us. 
                  This experience showed me that with enough <span>dedication and perseverance</span>, I could build these new skills—and, for the first time, <span>I felt certain about the direction I wanted my career to take.</span>

                <p>Since October, I have been continuing my studies on my own through The Odin Project, though I <span>miss the interaction with other students </span>. This journey has been transformative, and I’m excited to continue developing my skills and connecting with others in the tech community.
