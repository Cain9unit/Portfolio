                <h2>Hello, I'm Pierre</h2>
                <p>A 29-year-old aspiring software developer from Antwerp. 
                    Originally trained in criminology, I recently discovered a passion for
                     software development and testing, which has led me to pursue a 
                     new path in programming. Although I’m still new to the field,
                      I've found immense satisfaction in ta
                      ckling and solving challenging
                       problems. I’m eager to learn as much as possible and one day hope to work 
                       as a developer in a position where i can make a positive impact on society.

                  <p>I started my professional journey as a KYC analyst and a consultant for the youth court. It quickly became clear that I hadn’t yet found the right career path. Though my education is in a different field, I've always had a deep interest in Tech and IT. Opportunely, a friend invited me to interview for a test engineering role. At the time, I had no background in software testing, but I quickly immersed myself in studying the theory behind this subject and found it incredibly engaging.

                </div>

                <div class="card">
                <p>Though I didn’t land the job due to my lack of experience, the process inspired me to earn an ISTQB certification and continue exploring software testing in-depth. I began networking with professionals in the field, and they encouraged me to look into Campus 19, a free coding bootcamp. Admittedly, the idea of learning to code was daunting—developers had always seemed like the magicians of our time, and I wasn’t sure if I could keep up. Still, I decided to take the leap, and in September, I dedicated myself fully to learning programming.

                <p>The intensive month-long “Piscine” was eye-opening. Coding was as challenging as I’d imagined, but also incredibly rewarding. I worked alongside people from all backgrounds, tackling complex problems without any teachers to guide us. This unique experience showed me that with enough dedication and perseverance, I could master new skills—and, for the first time, I felt certain about the direction I wanted my career to take.

                <p>Since October, I have been continuing my studies on my own through The Odin Project, though I miss the interaction with other students. This journey has been transformative, and I’m excited to continue developing my skills and connecting with others in the tech community.
